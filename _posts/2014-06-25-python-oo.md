### introduction

#### Keyword: class

example:

```
>>> class student(object):
...     pass
... 
>>> wang=student()
>>> wang
<__main__.student object at 0x7f387d87e890>
```

#### inheritance: 

```
class xxx(parent):
	...
```

#### init

```
class xxx(parent):
	def __init__(self, xxx1, xxx2)
		self.x1 = xxx1
		self.x2 = xxx2
```

After this, you must produce a object using `my=xxx(xxx1, xxx2)`.

#### differences with static programming language

The struct of a concrete object can change dynamically.

here is an example, object wang got a name in it's structure, but not object liu.

```
>>> class student(object):
...     pass
... 
>>> wang=student()
>>> liu=student()
>>> wang.name='wangmazi'
>>> wang.name
'wangmazi'
>>> liu.name
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'student' object has no attribute 'name'
```

### private member

If you want to protect some members of a class from bad using or over written, you can using this method by adding `__` before that member.

Here is the example:

```
>>> class Student(object):
...     def __init__(self, name, age):
...             self.__name=name
...             self.__age=age
... 
>>> wang=Student('wangxx', 11)
>>> print wang.__name
Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute '__name'
```

But in most versions of python, you still can address it by _ClassName__member, which is not recommended.

```
>>> print wang._Student__name
wangxx
```

### other useful ops

```
isinstance(obj, className) # determine if an obj is an instance of a given class. True of False.

dir(obj) or dir(className) # get all attrs in an obj or a classType.

hasattr(obj, 'attrName') # determine weather an obj contains a member named 'attrName'.

getattr(obj, 'attrName') # get attr, exit with err msg if not exit.
getattr(obj, 'attrName', value) # get attr, return value if not exit.
```
